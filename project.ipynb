    "The first few sentences should give a quick overview of the entire project. Then, elaborate with a description of the problem that will be solved, a brief history (with [citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation)) of how the problem came about, why it's important/interesting, and any other interesting facts you'd like to talk about. You should address and explain where the problem data is coming from (research? the internet? synthetically generated?) Also give an outline of the rest of the report.*\n",

    "A discussion of the modeling assumptions made in the problem (e.g. is it from physics? economics? something else?). Explain the decision variables, the constraints, and the objective function. Finally, show the optimization problem written in standard form. Discuss the model type (LP, QP, MIP, etc.). Equations should be formatted in $\\LaTeX$ within the IJulia notebook. For this section you may **assume the reader is familiar with the material covered in class**."

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions.\n",

The discussion should explain what the results mean, and how to interpret them. You should also explain the limitations of your approach/model and how sensitive your results are to the assumptions you made."
